# Tentacles
SquidKit's networking library for iOS

## About

Tentacles is a networking library for iOS based on the excellent and refreshingly simple [Networking](https://github.com/3lvis/Networking) library by [@3lvis](https://twitter.com/3lvis).

#### Why Tentacles?

I started using the [Networking](https://github.com/3lvis/Networking) library for my projects because I grew frustrated with my previous networking library of choice - Alamofire - which was constantly changing their API in breaking ways. I also felt that Alamofire was simply growing too complex. However, I soon realized that I was implementing common networking related tasks over and over. An example of this is response caching. So, I decided I wanted a networking library that had a built-in and robust caching model. There were other niceties I wanted (e.g. built-in reachability), along with a slight variant on the API structure that Networking offered. These changes were significant enough that a fork wouldn't do, so I started over - with Networking's model as a base - and came up with this.

#### Usage
*Don't!*

Tentacles is still in beta. While it functions well, it is neither complete nor fully tested.

More to come soon...
